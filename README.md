# Jacob Leone's Tech Gallery

Driven by an intrinsic passion for tackling creative and technical challenges as a team player. I thrive on collaboration towards a shared mission: delivering exceptional value to the world in an efficient manner...

## Background

Before diving into the tech arena, I pursued an intensive graduate program at FAU, a top-tier university, focusing on the convergence of artificial intelligence, signal & image processing and psychology. This academic journey endowed me with a unique lens: approaching AI development from a human first perspective and a deep understanding of the nuanced ways people interface with machines. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am a perpetual learner, drawing from experiences that span leadership, creativity, problem-solving, and architecting projects from mere ideas to successful execution.

Some of my technical hobbies include audio plugin development, computer graphics programming and music production. When i'm not working on side projects I like to enjoy long hikes and yoga to ease the mind and counteract the consequences of sitting at my desk all day. I see my workspace as a sort of alter or shrine where I put forth my ideas into the world and receive knowledge in exchange. 

If you set your mind to something you can achieve anything you desire.
