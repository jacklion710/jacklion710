# Jacob Leone's Tech Gallery

Driven by an intrinsic passion for tackling creative and technical challenges and as member of agile development teams, I thrive on collaboration towards a shared mission: delivering exceptional value to clients efficiently...

## Background

Before diving into the tech arena, I pursued an intensive graduate program at a top-tier university, focusing on the convergence of artificial intelligence and psychology. This academic journey endowed me with a unique lens: approaching AI development from a human first perspective and a deep understanding of the nuanced ways people interface with machines. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am a perpetual learner, drawing from experiences that span leadership, creativity, problem-solving, and architecting projects from mere ideas to successful execution.
