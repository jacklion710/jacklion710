Machine Learning Engineer specializing in signal and image processing, with hands-on experience developing AI-driven solutions...

## Background

My expertise spans implementing computer vision algorithms, processing complex signal data, and designing ML pipelines that bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications. Building on my graduate research in AI-medical device integration, I combine strong technical capabilities in deep learning and signal processing with a commitment to creating reliable, ethical AI systems. I excel in collaborative environments where I can apply my analytical mindset to solve challenging technical problems while maintaining a user-centric approach.

Some of my technical hobbies include audio plugin development, shader programming and music production. When I'm not working on side projects I like to enjoy long hikes and yoga to ease the mind and counteract the consequences of sitting at my desk all day. I see my workspace as a sort of alter or shrine where I put forth my ideas into the world and receive knowledge in exchange. 

If you set your mind to something you can achieve anything you desire.
